### [Professor Kushida](https://aparc.fsi.stanford.edu/people/kenji_e_kushida) (B)
We met Professor Kushida. He is a Japan Program Research Scholar at the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center and an affiliated researcher at the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. He actively appealed how nice the Silicon Valley is, and invites some Japanese companies to SV. As he has deep insight in Japanese economy and American University authorization, we got some advice from him.

### [Mighty Buildings](https://www.mightybuildings.com/) (C)
[Mighty Buildings](https://www.mightybuildings.com/) is a stealth-mode startup working on making housing more affordable with 3DP tech and automation. Their strength is that they have already developed the 3DP which can build the Container house. They showed me the product, but not allowed to share on the SNS, so pleas look at [here](https://www.facebook.com/mightybuildings/videos/204401590455156/).

As Japan is one of the most disaster-prone countries, we need the technologies to build the temporary house, so we will hear the company name in Japan near future.

### [CITRIS Foundry](https://citrisfoundry.org/) (D)
[CITRIS Foundry](https://citrisfoundry.org/) is the University of California's deep tech innovation hub. They help innovators and entrepreneurs from University of California make a significant impact on the world. You can see the portfolios of these companies [here](https://citrisfoundry.org/portfolio/).

As we met at **"450 (4th floor) of Sutardja Dai Hall on UC Berkeley Campus"**, where [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) locates, I'm very excited to visit such a wonderful environment and met the people in there. I thought the hometown of the students in UC Berkeley were different from each other, and they enjoyed the chemical reaction resulting from such diversities.

###  (E)
We explained the strategies and strengths of our companies, and they seemed to get interest in us. I felt the insights of their members were excellent, so if they stand behind us, it is very encouraging for us.

### [Dinner](https://www.legaragebistrosausalito.com/location/le-garage-bistro/) (F)
We had a dinner with Norio-san, who is now doing directors of several companies. He stays America for more than 30 years since he went there to study Artificial Intelligence. As he has 3 ships, we met him in one of them and drunk a wine from his winery, then went to the restaurants.

I could realize the **American Dream** first-hand though this wonderful experience.

We took a picture on the ship.

### Back to Home
I felt a fever, so took a medicine.

It seemed that my body was screaming because the stimulus was too strong. However, it was so much fun that I did not want to get sick. I hope my condition will recover tomorrow...
