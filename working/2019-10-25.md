### [Chooch AI](https://chooch.ai/) (B)
[Chooch AI](https://chooch.ai/) (meaning **choose + search**) is a complete visual AI platform, with an API, a dashboard and mobile SDK. Combining computer vision training with machine learning. It offers object recognition and facial authentication, with autonomous labeling, data collection, neural network selection and more.

You can download Chooch Demo, or play in the browser [here](https://chooch.ai/demo/).

The mechanism is as follows:
1. Detect the object from images.
2. Creates feature vector from the detected image.
3. Compare it to those in the database.
4. If the similarity score is bigger than some threshold (or distance is smaller than threshold), the class label will appear in the screen.

The strong points of them are that **"their model automatically determine the threshold for each task"**, and **"the processing speed"**. I was impressed and got interest in them, so I asked too much about technical points of them.

### [Blumio](https://blumio.com/) (C)
[Blumio](https://blumio.com/) is an algorithm company. As the information available from wearable monitors is limited and noisy, so their algorithms transform them into accurate and promising data.

The more: [Arterial Pulse Measurement with Wearable Millimeter Wave Device - IEEE Conference Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8771037)

### [Frontier Bio](https://www.frontierbio.com/) (E)
[Frontier Bio](https://www.frontierbio.com/) developed an advanced bioprinter (FLUX-1) that combines conventional bioprinting technologies with the advanced capabilities of electro-hydrodynamic printing (EHDP). It can be used for a large number of bioprinting applications because it can print at **nanoscale**!!

As it locates in the [bioCURIOUS](http://biocurious.org/), which is the facility where various bio lab gathers, I could look around a lot of interesting companies. Very excited :)

### [OneSkin Technologies](https://www.oneskintechnologies.com/) (F)
[OneSkin Technologies](https://www.oneskintechnologies.com/) is developing solutions to enable people to age better, healthier, and with better quality of life. It seems interesting, but as they had already entered Series A, which is out of our investment domain, we decided to keep in touch.

### [Googleplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex) (G)
As we had a time, we visited [Googleplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex), but as we didn't have a connection with employees, we only looked around.

I hope I will go back here as an engineer someday.

### [Denar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/palo-alto-creamery-palo-alto-2) (H)
It was volumy, and greasy taste, or the most American food I have ever eaten. It was a "great" experience.

### [Stanford Shopping Center]() (I)
We bought some souvenirs here. It was the first time for me to see the **Microsoft Store**.
