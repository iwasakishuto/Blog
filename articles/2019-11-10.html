<p>From November 8 to 10, I participated in the OIST, <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/skill-pills-plus">Skill Pills+</a>, which provides a unique opportunity for students in Japan to learn about research being conducted in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLeylXbZDpo">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST)</a> directly from active researchers.</p>
<p>The reason why I participated in it was that I was interested in "OIST" and "Neuroscience".</p>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASMBV6R2JMBVPLBJ001.html">some newspaper reported</a> that OIST is the most suitable environment for research in Japan, I wanted to visit and experience the life.</li>
<li>I'm now trying the task of <strong>"Object Tracking"</strong> using deep learning techniques, and I noticed when occlusion (someone hide behind the other) occurs, the performance will drastically decrease. I thought it is due to the memory mechanism, so I wanted to learn how the brain memorize and recognize the pattern, and reverse these flexible mechanism to computer models.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fri. 10/8</h3>
<p>We arrived the Naha Airport at 16:00. As Workshop handbook (participants introduction was in) was already available and the seat in the airplane was close to each other, I got to know some participants before the meeting time.</p>
<p>One of them made this program much much better, so I'll call him <strong>"S"</strong> later. He had an experience doing internship in OIST this summer, so he knew OIST very well.</p>
<p><img alt="20191109.jpg" src="theme/img/20191109.jpg">
We ate Okinawa soba at the airport with some participants.</p>
<p>After arrived to OIST accommodation, <a href="https://www.oist.jp/seaside-house-0">Seaside House</a>, we had a dinner with the members of <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/ncbc">Neural Coding and Brain Computing Unit</a>. They were very kind and listened eagerly to my English.</p>
<p>Then, we had a free time. First of all, I planed to walk to a convenience store with participants to deepen the friendship, but <strong>"S"</strong> invited me to a nearby bar, <a href="https://grandline.ti-da.net/">GRANDLINE</a>, so I went to there.</p>
<p>It was the only bar near the Oist, so there were many students in OIST, they were all friendly and we enjoyed talking till 2:00 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>I had already liked OIST at that time.</strong></p>
<h3>Sat. 10/9</h3>
<p>From 9:00 to 18:00, we had been listening to lectures. I summarized what I learned, so if you are interested in them, please look <a href="https://iwasakishuto.github.io/University/3A/categories.html#oist-ref">here</a>.</p>
<p>After the lecture, we had a dinner at OIST, and went back to the accommodation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a farewell party for one of the members in OIST, and they were kind enough to invite us. As I had never participated in such party before, I was a little confused, but gradually got used to it and enjoyed it.</p>
<h3>Sun. 10/10</h3>
<p>We had some advanced lecture and finished the all programs.</p>
<p>Of course the lecture was interesting, <strong>the most impressive thing was the atmosphere of OIST</strong>. People in there were very friendly and open. This experience deepened my desire to study abroad.</p>
