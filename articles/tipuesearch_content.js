I think it is a good opportunity, so look back on the things so far. Merits Time I think we can use time very efficiently. This is of course our house is close to the university, but because we are stimulating each other. I am always in an environment with competitors, so I can do my best so as not to lose them. I felt that knowing people was logarithmic. In other words, the more you know, the less you get to know, and finally, the amount will converge to nearly zero. Of course, I am not convinced that at that time, I know all of that person. However, the speed of housemates getting new skills is faster than that of I know them. That's why I am exciting to live with them. This environment was what I have long wanted for, so I'm very happy now and very proud of my criteria I used to decide who to live with. Friendship Thanks to housemates, from 100 days before, my friendship has expanded considerably. It was also one of the criteria to choose those who communicate actively. As I chose active people, they often bring in various interesting friends, which often increase the friendship. In addition, it is often the things that some of my friends who had only been connected in a single line became connected with multiple lines. It makes our friendship stronger and deeper. In summarize, the sharehouse expands and strengthen my friendships. Mental sources The big difference from living alone is that there are always friends in the house. As one of my housemates tweeted like this, I'm very sad coming back without someone at home. 家に帰って1人だった時の寂しさが異常すぎて一生一人暮らしできなさそう — 山田 大介@キャディ最年少リーダー(予定) (@yamaddesu) 2019年5月14日 I am extremely happy to have a companion who will cheer me up, and I can count on. Demerits There is nothing. Really. ... Yup. There is nothing. Future goals We are somewhat selfish. We don't do shopping, washing, and cleaning much voluntarily. This house is not \"my\" house, but \"our\" house. I want build the relationships that we can do the housework \"for others\" and help each other like McKinsey.","tags":"diary","url":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-05-20.html","loc":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-05-20.html"},{"title":"What is the gender??","text":"What is the difference between man and woman? Today, I have watched a performance of a circle called \"Todai Love Live!\". The reason I went to see was that \"the department's sync belongs to this circle\" and \"My friend invited me\", so I was not really interested in it until I went. However, as I went there, I changed the way to see them, and the geeks including them. I would like to summarize what I am thinking now. geeks' good manners First, I thought that the geeks were very kindly men who protected their manners. They listened carefully the announce and did not do things they were told not to (ex. Jump, lift people, MIX.). In addition, they respected the actors and spoked out to cheer the performers. I was also moved by such attitude What is the diff? The next thing is that even boys are pretty. I am not a gay and a love target is girl, but I thought that the face can be girlish with makeup (the aunt who watched the performance in front of me was surprised that \"Hmm? are they boys?? I considered them completely girls.), the behavior can be changed. Furthermore, the style and shape were rather good. I lost the distinction between man and woman. 2D Finally they were three-dimensional, but Love Live! is originally a two-dimensional animation. I could not see two-dimensional geeks with good eyes until today, but I thought it was all right. Moreover, I thought it stands to reason. Two-dimensions can easily realize the ideal performances and is permanent. I felt sympathy for the pursuit of eternal things. Finally Their group ID is \"\".

My policy \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is my motto, and \"There is no growth without change\" expresses the way of my life. Of course, I have to be grateful to my environment in which I can choose changes. Anyway, I decide on my mind to avoid talking as if I knew something deeply even though I have never tried or seen it. If I have a chance, I would like to express by myself and not relying on other people's opinions. 2. get too accustomed to working This is one of the best reasons why I think \"There is no growth without change.\" It is scary to get accustomed to something. When we get accustomed to it, it is also the time when we lose awareness of what we have been aware of until then. I want to feel a sort of pressure to do my best. In addition, I believe that it will be quite profitable to make an effort to get evaluation and be trusted by others from the place where the evaluation is 0. 3. Machine Learning field When I did a Hackathon with Neural Pocket, I feel they have a good image processing skills and knowledge. For example, to know where CNN watches, they used GradCAM, and analyze with the data that CNN have identified to understand what is the deciding factor of misrecognition. I have interest in Computer Vision (that's why my first python web application is Arashi Recognition), and I feel I can get a lot of knowledge if I work at Neural Pocket. 4. English There are many skillful foreign engineers, and I have to communicate in English, I am not good at speaking english, but I want to try my ability at this exciting environment. 5. More Severity As I mentioned about this at reason 2, I wanted a tough environment. For these reasons, I retired Data Artist, and start a new internship at Neural Pocket next month!!","tags":"resolution","url":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-03-29.html","loc":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-03-29.html"},{"title":"Start a share house","text":"Why I leave my house? There are three biggest reasons, \"For the future\" , \"Independence\" , and \"Growth\" . 1. For the future I currently do an internship activity as a data scientist at a company, Data Artist . From my own experience, I think what is important for data scientists is \"understanding of machine learning theory\" and \"understanding of data\". Of course, the latter one can be realized by analyzing the data, but I think being taught and gained from those familiar with that field is more important. In addition, as you can see from the fact that \"Neural Networks\" were originally modeled on human neurons, it is powerful way to incorporate ideas and knowledge from other fields. That's why my current future dream is \"become a member of the Straw Hats\". Straw Hats is a pirate team in the ONEPIECE, and all the members on board excel in a different field and are wanted person with reward, in other words, ability is very high. I want to make such an organization and provide value to members. Fortunately, I could enroll in the University of Tokyo, where there are a lot of people who study in other disciplines to me in the same campus. I would like to communicate with such people, and increase the range of what I can and what I know. However, I think becoming mere acquaintance gives little to each other. For example, suppose you get a business card from an adult. Half year ago, I was pleased as if I became a businees man, but that was just a \"social manner\", and what I could get by exchanging business cards was about name, phone number, and job title of that person, only information we could search on the Internet. I do not want to get the relationships that we can't provide value to each other, so I think it is more important to build a relationship that both need each other than to have 100 business cards. The point is that I think it is more important to build deeper relationships and expand that than just expand acquaintance community. Let's get back on track. The 2 friends who start a share house with me this time study Economics, and Information Science, both regions are I am especially interested in. Besides, they do internship activity and are very sociable. I have an allure for them, and their friends. Therefore, I think it is possible to create a good community by becoming more intimate and spreading friendship relations with each other, while making a living with them. 2. Independence I am now 20 years old. Socially it is the age called \"adult\". However, since I currently live in my parent's house, I don't do \"what I should do as an adult\", such as official procedures, self catering, washing, etc. Last month, I went to real estate for the first time, and learned the meaning of \"security deposit\", and \"caution money\" It is already said that \"Todai students can only study\", I would like to acquire the ability to live in society by doing them on my own. 3. Growth One of my beliefs is \"You have to change in order to grow.\" I live in my parents' house now, and it is a perfect environment. Some may feel it is a waste to let go of such an environment. However, I believe that living there has a negative impact on my growth. I feel that \"the difference between 0 and 1 is larger than the difference between 1 and 10\". I want to experience by myself. Also, my housemates are excellent people, so feeling their lifestyle, growth and what they are thinking from experience is much more exciting than the current environment. I want to put myself in an exciting environment, so I decided to start a share house. How to make a living? Currently, I have a saving of 1 million yen and I think it is a sufficient amount as the initial funds. However, it is necessary to obtain sustained money. It is possible to pay myself by increasing the time of internship activity, but then the meaning of share house will be reduced. So, I plan to get aid from my parents for about 30,000 yen a month. Of course, I will return this money. Determination As you may have understood so far, I do not intend to do a share house for \"to play\", \"to escape parental constraints\", \"to invite a girl to my house\". I would like to share house for \"my dream\". It may occur that I often refuse an invitation, for the reason that I need to earn and save money, but I hope you continue to invite and get in touch with me in the future.","tags":"resolution","url":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-01-20.html","loc":"https://iwasakishuto.github.io/blog/articles/2019-01-20.html"},{"title":"Happy new year 2019!!","text":"Happy new year!! Thanks to my all friends, I spent the best last year. However, I want to spend better this year, so I'm counting on you. New Year's resolution Last year, I changed my environment drastically, for example, starting internship activity, retiring from boxing club, and so on. I don't regret all about my choices, because these choices made me grew up so much. I think a mere change means nothing, but if there is a strong will, it helps you to grow up. That's why, I first thought my new year's resolution is as follows. Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action comes, stop thinking and go in. ~Napoléon Bonaparte~ However, I think this is too serious, and does not suit me. Then, I came up with a better one. Live like Beaujolais nouveau. This means \"Challenge with confidence to make tomorrow much much better than today.\" Anyway, I am looking forward to your continuous support.

I'm a sophomore majoring Bioinformatics. I'm curious about machine learning, and the gene, so I'm now studying both of them. In the future, I want to make some models, in particular HMM (Hidden Markov Model) with my knowledge of biology to predict where are the important regions in the very large amount of base sequences. Why I start this blog There are two reasons: First reason This picture's comment influenced me so much. I am a big worrier, and hate to show my weaknesses, so I always prepare too much, and aim to be perfect. However, there were a lots and lots of people who were greater than me in the University of Tokyo, so I lost confidence, in other words, I was bothered by the \"Todai Caste.\" At that time, I encountered this phrase, and it saved me. I felt I got a permission to speak from an imperfect position. After I present my skills, works, and interests, many people turned their attention to me, and I could get a lot of chances to communicate with engineers who have an amazing skills. In summary, I thought \"Say nothing is as good as dead.\" That's why I made this website. Second reason One of my frinds has his website, and he said that \"this is for my child.\" It made me realize that \"even though no one could be a perfect human by oneself (∵ time is finite), one might be by teaching one another with others.\" This is the second reason. Why I write in English? There are too many reasons, so I write the biggest one. Many people say that machine could understand Natural Language, like BERT . I admit it will come true eventually, but it may take a couple of years to be the world, so we should acquire an ability to communicate in English now. In addition, I love speaking English, because English makes me cheerful, so I want to be fluent in English. My FLOW teacher, Bueno Alex Falcon said to me that \"the more you speak English, the better you speak English,\" so I trust him and using English now.
